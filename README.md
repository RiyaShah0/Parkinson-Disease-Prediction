# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction
A system that predicts an early onset of Parkinson disease.
Various ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM and XGBoost are run to predict the Parkinson's disease. Also used a combination of deep learning models RNN and LSTM for prediction.
On comparing the accuarcy of the implemented models, explainable ai(SHAP) model is implemented on the best model to check transparency and shap summary plot is generated.
